# 📘 Learning Log – C# Console Applications

This repository is my **daily learning log for C#**.  
I upload code almost every day — even for the **smallest concepts** — to track my progress and reinforce learning through practice.

All implementations are done using a **Console Application**, where each file focuses on a specific concept, logic, or problem.

The goal of this repo is **learning, consistency, and clarity**, not perfection.

---

## 🚀 What This Repository Contains

- Beginner-friendly C# programs  
- Core programming concepts  
- Logical problem-solving  
- Console-based implementations  
- Incremental daily learning  

Each file represents **something new I learned that day**.
